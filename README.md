# Bullet Hell
by Leo Zhu, John Lins, Jennifer Lopez, and Kevin Lee

For our arcade game, we have created a bullet hell style game. While everything is not implemented yet, the idea of the game is to have the player clear waves of enemies in order to complete a level. 
Further along in the project, enemies will be able to be destroyed once they are hit by enough projectiles. Enemies will also be able to fire projectiles at the player which can cause the player to lose a life. After a wave of enemies is defeated, the next wave will come in. The game will continue until all the enemies have been defeated or the player loses all their lives.


## How to Play

Once the window loads, the player's position is controlled by the mouse. The playerâ€™s character can fire projectiles at the enemies by using the `spacebar`. The enemies will begin to move around the screen in an attempt to dodge the projectiles.


## How to Compile Using The Makefile

To build the game:
- Open your terminal use `make`
- Then use `make run`
- To clean up built files, use `make clean`.

## Exiting The Game
Use the command `ctrl C` on your terminal to exit the game.
